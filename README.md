# Password Checker Website

This is a simple web-based password checker that evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria. It provides real-time feedback on the password strength as you type.

## Features

- **Strength Indicator:** Visual representation of password strength.
- **Criteria Check:** Evaluates passwords based on length, character variety, and common patterns.

## Demo

You can view a live demo [here](https://password-checker-2407.netlify.app/).

## Usage

To use the password checker, simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. Enter a password in the input field to see its strength evaluation.

### File Structure



```
/password-checker
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── script.js
``` 


- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the password input and display area.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the password checker and its components.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for checking password strength.

## How It Works

1. **Input Field:** The user types a password into the input field.
2. **Real-Time Feedback:** The strength of the password is evaluated in real-time based on predefined criteria.
3. **Strength Indicator:** The website displays a visual indicator showing how many criterias the password satisfies.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the criteria in `script.js` and the styles in `styles.css` to change how the password strength is evaluated and displayed.
